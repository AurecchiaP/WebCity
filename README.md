# WebCity

WebCity is a web application that, given some Java system hosted on GitHub, it produces a navigable and interactive 3D representation of the system.

It is built with Play Framework 2.5.12, and it requires Scala version 2.11 and Java 1.8 or higher.

The server can be downloaded and ran locally. Alternatively, an already deployed version can be found at http://rio.inf.usi.ch:39000
